# hybrid-adaptation-Voron-2.4
A project inspired by the RatRig VCore 4 about the Hybrid system,
at the moment I managed to complete the initial iteration of the project (on the CAD side).
As soon as I can I'll test it in my Voron 2.4r2 that has been modified, 
I'll make sure to release a compatible version for all the different types of gantry.
